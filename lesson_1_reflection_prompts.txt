How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helps to see what are the changes that occurred from the earlier release. If you see that, 
    there shouldn't be a difference with certain portion of your file and that portion appear in your diff, 
    you can make out there are unwanted things that happened.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It helps to see how a file has evolved over a period of time. You can understand 
    why certain code is added or removed and what features have introduced or optimized like that.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    By manually committing, you have control of what are the changes to be in the commit. It could accommodate
    logical changes part of a commit. But you have to be careful, not to forget as you have made enough changes
    related to one logical change. If you forget, it will be huge changes to commit later.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is more specifically for codes and some cases, the different files are related together and it makes sense
    to commit them together so that they all make a functionality.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log : will give u the history commits on this repository
	git diff --stat <old_commitID> <new_commitID>

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can always get back to old working state incase if I accidently make some mistakes and it changes the functionality.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to work with my projects using Git, so that I can track the changes.
