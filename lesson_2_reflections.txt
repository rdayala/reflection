What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It creates an hidden .git directory. This is required so that it keep track of files that are present
	in the repository. History of changes to the files in the repository will be maintained.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	You may have many files in your working directory, but staging area contains only files that you want to 
	include as part of your commit. You add files individually to the staging area and when you commit them, they all
	go as a single unit to the repository as part of a single commit.
